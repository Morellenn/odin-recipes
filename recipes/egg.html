            <h2>Below is a basic recipe and step by step instructions to make Scrambled Eggs.</h2>

            <u><h3>Ingredients</h3></u>
            <ul>
                <li>2 Large free range eggs</li>
                <li>6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk</li>
                <li>1 tbsp of butter</li>
            </ul>

            <u><h3>Steps</h3></u>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream (or full cream milk) and a pinch of salt together until the  mixture has just one consistency.</li>
                <br> <li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add the butter and let it melt <br> Don't allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.</li>
                <br> <li>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan</li>
                <br> <li>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again</li>
                <br> <li>Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.</li>
                <br> <li>Give it one final stir and then serve up.</li>
            </ol>
