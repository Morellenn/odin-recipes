                <ol>
                 <li>Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream (or full cream milk) and a pinch of salt together until the  mixture has just one consistency.</li>
                 <br><li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add the butter and let it melt <br> Don't allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.</li>
                 <br> <li>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan</li>
                 <br> <li>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again</li>
                 <br> <li>Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.</li>
                 <br> <li>Give it one final stir and then serve up.</li>
